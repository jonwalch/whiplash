## Front End Development

CSS source files are located in `/resources/css`, and will be processed via Gulp and output to `/resources/public/css/App.css`. JS files are located in `/resources/public/js`.

- `npm run develop`: Build CSS
- `npm run watch:css`: Build CSS and watch for changes (run this before `watch:js`)
- `npm run watch:js`: Build JS and watch for changes (run this after `watch:css` in another terminal tab/window)
- `npm run build`: Build CSS and JS, and minify CSS for production

### Note

CSS gets inlined in `index.html`, which is fine for now. As the number of styles and pages grow, we will want to link styles in a cacheable `.css` file that gets served separately. Most important, 'above the fold' styles can stay inline.
